The ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H), founded in 2018 by ITU-T in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), is creating a standardized framework for the assessment of AI and machine learning models for health. FG-AI4H's scope and general process are described in a commentary in [The Lancet](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30762-7) and a [white paper](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Documents/FG-AI4H_Whitepaper.pdf). You are welcome to participate in the FG-AI4H, which is open to all and free of charge. For more information on FG-AI4H, please visit the main website: https://www.itu.int/go/fgai4h/
