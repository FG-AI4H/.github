# About FG-AI4H

The ITU/WHO Focus Group on artificial intelligence for health (FG-AI4H) works in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish a standardized assessment framework for the evaluation of AI-based methods for health, diagnosis, triage or treatment decisions. Participation in the FG-AI4H is free of charge and open to all. The group was established by ITU-T Study Group 16 at its meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia, 9-20 July 2018. 

The FG scope and general process are described in a commentary in [The Lancet](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30762-7) and a [white paper](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Documents/FG-AI4H_Whitepaper.pdf).
